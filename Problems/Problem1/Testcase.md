### Test Case 1

**Input:**

```cpp
arr = {2, 1, 5, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1}
k = 2
```

**Expected Output:**

```cpp
3 // Elements at indices 1, 4, and 7 form the longest subsequence
```

### Test Case 2

**Input:**

```cpp
arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
k = 1
```

**Expected Output:**

```cpp
1 // Each element is unique, so the longest subsequence for any element is 1
```

### Test Case 3

**Input:**

```cpp
arr = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
k = 3
```

**Expected Output:**

```cpp
3 // Elements at indices 0, 3, and 6 form the longest subsequence
```

### Test Case 4

**Input:**

```cpp
arr = {1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2}
k = 2
```

**Expected Output:**

```cpp
4 // Elements at indices 0, 2, 4, and 6 form the longest subsequence for element 1
```

### Test Case 5

**Input:**

```cpp
arr = {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3}
k = 1
```

**Expected Output:**

```cpp
8 // All elements are the same and each element can be included since k=1
```

### Test Case 6

**Input:**

```cpp
arr = {4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5}
k = 3
```

**Expected Output:**

```cpp
2 // Elements at indices 0 and 3 form the longest subsequence for element 4
```

### Test Case 7

**Input:**

```cpp
arr = {10, 20, 10, 20, 10, 20, 10, 20, 10}
k = 4
```

**Expected Output:**

```cpp
2 // Elements at indices 0 and 4 form the longest subsequence for element 10
```

### Test Case 8

**Input:**

```cpp
arr = {-10, -10, -20, -20, -30, -30, -10, -10, -20, -20}
k = 2
```

**Expected Output:**

```cpp
3 // Elements at indices 0, 2, and 4 form the longest subsequence for element -10
```

### Test Case 9

**Input:**

```cpp
arr = {1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000}
k = 1
```

**Expected Output:**

```cpp
8 // All elements are the same and each element can be included since k=1
```

### Test Case 10

**Input:**

```cpp
arr = {-1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000}
k = 2
```

**Expected Output:**

```cpp
3 // Elements at indices 0, 2, and 4 form the longest subsequence for element -1000000000
```
