## Problem: Longest Subsequence with Distance Constraint

Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `k`, find the length of the longest subsequence `s` such that all elements in the subsequence are the same and the distance between any two elements is at least `k`.

### Example

For example, if `arr = [2, 1, 5, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1]` and `k = 2`, a valid subsequence would be the elements at indices (0-based indexing) 1, 4, and 7.

### Constraints

- 0 < k < N < 10^5
- -10^9 < arr[i] < 10^9
