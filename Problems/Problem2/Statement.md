## Problem: Longest N-Good Subsequence

Given a string `s` of length `M` containing only lowercase English alphabets (a-z), find the length of the longest subsequence of `s` which is N-good.
A string is defined as **N-good** if for **every** ` 1 < x < N `, there exists exactly one character with frequency `x`.

### Constraints

- 1 < M < 10^5
